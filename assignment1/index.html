          The primary goal of the website is to provide an educational and
          immersive exploration of the architectural process. It offers users an
          in-depth look at the author's ideas and how they developed from
          initial sketches to completed models.

          One of the most fascinating aspects of my interactive experience was

          small discoveries to significant ones, including 3D models,
          photographs, videos, 2D sketches, and more. This approach is
          impressive in terms of educational value, as it makes the experience

          The interactive experience offered by this website effectively

        <p>
          First and foremost, the experience of this website is a progressive
          exploration over time. Visitors could watch some videos and discover
          3D models or sketches to have an overview information of Gehry's work.
          After that, they could come back later to gain more deep information
          from reading about the creative process. Over time, visitors could
          revisit the website as a reference for their studies.

        <p>
          I would say, this website is considered a digital museum because the
          experience encourages repeated engagement. This lets users come back
          over time rather than a one-time visit because the more they interact
          with the site, the more new insights they can gain from its
          interactive content.
